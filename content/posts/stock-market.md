## What it is

The stock market is a system where people buy and sell ownership shares of companies.

A share (or stock) represents a small piece of a business. If you own shares, you own part of that company.

Stock markets include exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, where buyers and sellers trade through regulated systems.

## Why

The stock market matters for both companies and individuals.

For companies, it can:

- raise money for growth
- fund new products and hiring
- expand operations

For investors, it can:

- build long-term wealth
- provide dividend income (for some companies)
- spread risk through diversification

It also acts as a broad signal of business confidence and economic expectations.

## How does it work

At a high level:

1. A company can issue shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO).
2. After that, shares trade between investors in the secondary market.
3. Prices move based on supply and demand.
4. Orders are matched by exchanges and market makers.
5. Broker platforms let individuals place buy and sell orders.

Key terms:

- **Market capitalization:** total value of a company’s shares.
- **Index:** a group of stocks used to track market performance (for example, S&P 500).
- **Volatility:** how much prices move over time.
- **Diversification:** spreading investments across assets to reduce risk.
