## What it is

This is a starter post for the blog.

It shows how Markdown content and front matter are structured in a Hugo project.

## Why

A starter post is useful because it gives a simple template for future writing.

You can copy this format and quickly create consistent articles.

## How does it work

Hugo reads Markdown files in `content/posts/` and builds web pages from them.

Each post includes front matter fields such as title, date, tags, and categories.

Typical workflow:

1. Create or edit a Markdown file in `content/posts/`
2. Run `hugo server` to preview locally
3. Run `hugo` to build static output in `public/`
