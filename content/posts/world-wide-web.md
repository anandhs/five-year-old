## What it is

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of linked documents and applications you access through a web browser.

It runs on top of the internet, but it is not the same thing as the internet.

- The **internet** is the global network infrastructure.
- The **web** is a service that uses that infrastructure.

Web content is usually built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript.

## Why

The web matters because it made information and software easy to share globally.

It enables:

- education and research access
- online communication and publishing
- e-commerce and digital services
- public information and government services

In practice, the web became a universal platform that works across many devices and operating systems.

## How does it work

At a high level, this is what happens when you open a website:

1. You enter a URL in a browser.
2. DNS translates the domain name into an IP address.
3. The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to a web server.
4. The server responds with resources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
5. The browser renders the page and runs scripts.
6. Additional requests may load more data through APIs.

The web also relies on standards so sites can work across browsers.

Key standards and technologies include:

- URL/URI for addressing resources
- HTTP for request/response communication
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for presentation and interaction
- TLS for secure encrypted connections (HTTPS)
