Computers feel like magic… but they’re actually **super fast rule-followers**.

A computer doesn’t “think” like a human.  
It follows instructions **very, very fast** — using electricity and tiny switches.

## 1) Computers speak ONE simple language: **1s and 0s**

Inside a computer, everything becomes:

- **1 = ON**
- **0 = OFF**

That’s it.

Games, YouTube, homework, Roblox, Minecraft — it all becomes huge patterns of **1s and 0s**.

## 2) The “brain” is the CPU

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the part that does the step-by-step work.

Think of it like:

- 🧠 a brain that follows rules
- 👨‍🍳 a chef following a recipe
- 🏭 a factory worker doing tiny tasks

It’s extremely fast — doing billions of tiny steps per second.

## 3) The real secret: billions of tiny switches (transistors)

Inside the CPU are **billions** of microscopic switches called **transistors**.

Each transistor can be:

- ON (1)
- OFF (0)

When you connect a *huge* number of these together, the computer can:

- add numbers
- compare things
- move data around
- follow “if this, then that” decisions

## 4) RAM is short-term memory (like a desk)

**RAM** is the computer’s short-term memory.

It’s like a desk where you keep the stuff you’re using *right now*.

Examples:
- the tabs you have open
- the game level currently loaded
