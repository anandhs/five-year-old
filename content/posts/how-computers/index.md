## What it is

A computer is an electronic system that takes input, processes data, and produces output.

It follows instructions from software and represents data in binary (`0` and `1`).

## Why

Computers matter because they help people process information quickly and reliably.

They power:

- communication and media
- education and research
- business and finance
- healthcare, transportation, and public services

## How does it work

At a high level:

- Input devices provide data (keyboard, mouse, sensors, network).
- The CPU executes instructions.
- RAM holds active data for fast access.
- Storage keeps data long term (SSD/HDD).
- Output devices show results (screen, speakers, files, network).

Inside hardware, transistors switch on and off to perform logic and arithmetic operations.
