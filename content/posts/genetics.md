# 🧬 What Is Genetics? (Explained Simply)

Have you ever looked at your family and thought…

“Why do I look like my dad?”  
“Why does my sister have curly hair but I don’t?”  
“Why are my eyes brown?”

The answer to all of those questions lives inside something tiny — something so small you can’t see it.

It’s called **DNA**.

And the study of DNA and how traits are passed down from parents to children is called **genetics**.

## 🧬 Your Body Has Instructions

Think of your body like the most advanced machine ever built.

Now imagine that inside every cell of your body, there’s a set of instructions telling it what to do. These instructions are written in a special code called **DNA**.

DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder. Inside that ladder is a code — like a recipe book for building *you*.

## 🧬 What Are Genes?

Inside DNA are smaller sections called **genes**.

A gene is like one instruction in the recipe.

For example:

- One gene might help decide your eye color  
- Another might influence your hair texture  
- Another might affect how tall you grow  

You have **thousands of genes** working together to make you who you are.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Why Do Families Look Alike?

You get half of your DNA from your mom and half from your dad.

That’s why:

- You might have your mom’s smile  
- Your dad’s nose  
- Or your grandparent’s laugh  

Genetics explains how traits are passed down through generations. It’s like mixing two sets of instructions together to create someone completely unique.
