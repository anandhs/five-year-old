## What it is

Genetics is the study of how traits are inherited and how biological information is passed from one generation to the next.

The main information molecule is DNA, and genes are useful sections of DNA that influence traits and body functions.

## Why

Genetics helps us understand:

- why family members can share traits
- why siblings can still be different
- how some diseases can run in families
- how personalized medicine can be designed

It also helps in agriculture, forensics, and disease research.

## How does it work

Each person inherits genetic material from both parents.

- DNA contains coded instructions.
- Genes affect how proteins are built and regulated.
- Variants in genes can influence visible traits and health risks.
- Environment and lifestyle also influence outcomes.

So most traits come from both genes and environment, not genes alone.
