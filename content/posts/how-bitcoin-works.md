## What it is

Bitcoin is a digital money system that works without a central bank.

Instead of one company controlling it, a global network of computers follows shared rules to record and verify transactions.

## Why

People use Bitcoin for a few main reasons:

- to send value directly over the internet
- to use a system with a fixed supply (21 million coins)
- to use money that is not controlled by one country or company

Whether it is a good choice depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and local laws.

## How does it work

Bitcoin runs on a public ledger called the blockchain.

- Transactions are broadcast to the network.
- The network checks signatures and balances.
- Valid transactions are grouped into blocks.
- Miners compete to add the next block using proof-of-work.
- Each new block confirms earlier transactions and strengthens the record.

Ownership is controlled by cryptographic keys:

- a public address to receive funds
- a private key to spend funds

If the private key is lost, access to funds is usually lost.
