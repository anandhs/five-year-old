## What it is

Calculus is the part of math used to study change and accumulation.

It has two core tools:

- derivatives for rates of change
- integrals for totals built from many small parts

## Why

Calculus helps when things are always changing, such as speed, growth, heat, flow, and cost.

It is widely used in:

- science and engineering
- economics and finance
- medicine and biology
- computing and machine learning

## How does it work

A derivative answers: "How fast is this changing right now?"

An integral answers: "What total do I get after adding tiny changes over time or space?"

These two ideas are connected by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which links rates of change and accumulation.
