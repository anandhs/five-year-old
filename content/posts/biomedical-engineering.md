## What it is

Biomedical engineering is the field that combines engineering and medicine to solve health problems.

It applies math, physics, biology, and computing to design tools and systems used in healthcare.

Examples include:

- medical imaging systems (like MRI and CT support technologies)
- prosthetic limbs and assistive devices
- heart monitors and wearable sensors
- surgical tools and medical software

## Why

Biomedical engineering matters because it helps people live longer, safer, and healthier lives.

It supports healthcare by:

- improving diagnosis speed and accuracy
- making treatments safer and more personalized
- helping patients recover mobility and function
- reducing hospital errors through better devices and data systems

It also connects doctors, researchers, and engineers so medical ideas can become practical products.

## How does it work

Biomedical engineering usually follows an engineering design process focused on patient needs.

1. Identify a real clinical problem.
2. Define requirements for safety, usability, and performance.
3. Design a prototype device, system, or algorithm.
4. Test it in lab settings and controlled trials.
5. Improve the design based on data and clinician feedback.
6. Validate quality and regulatory compliance before real-world use.

Common technical areas include:

- biomechanics (movement, force, and body mechanics)
- biomaterials (materials that can safely interact with the body)
- bioinstrumentation (sensors and medical electronics)
- medical imaging and signal processing
- tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
