    <div class="meta">Feb 16, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is Biomedical engineering is the field that combines engineering and medicine to solve health problems.
It applies math, physics, biology, and computing to design tools and systems used in healthcare.
Examples include:
medical imaging systems (like MRI and CT support technologies) prosthetic limbs and assistive devices heart monitors and wearable sensors surgical tools and medical software Why Biomedical engineering matters because it helps people live longer, safer, and healthier lives.

    <div class="meta">Feb 13, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is Reliability signals are metrics that help teams understand system health in production.
A common and useful set is:
latency traffic errors saturation Why These signals help teams detect and fix incidents faster.
They answer practical questions:
Is the system slow? Is demand changing? Are requests failing? Are resources near capacity? Together, they provide a strong baseline for operational decisions.
How does it work Teams collect and monitor these metrics over time.
