    <div class="meta">Feb 17, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is Visa and Mastercard are global card networks. They are not banks.
Their main role is to move payment information between the businesses and banks involved in a card transaction.
When you pay with a card, several parties are involved:
Cardholder (you) Merchant (the store) Issuing bank (the bank that gave you the card) Acquiring bank / payment processor (the merchant&rsquo;s side) Card network (Visa or Mastercard) Why These networks matter because they make electronic payments fast, standardized, and trusted across countries.

    <div class="meta">Feb 16, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is Bitcoin is a digital money system that works without a central bank.
Instead of one company controlling it, a global network of computers follows shared rules to record and verify transactions.
Why People use Bitcoin for a few main reasons:
to send value directly over the internet to use a system with a fixed supply (21 million coins) to use money that is not controlled by one country or company Whether it is a good choice depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and local laws.

    <div class="meta">Feb 16, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of linked documents and applications you access through a web browser.
It runs on top of the internet, but it is not the same thing as the internet.
The internet is the global network infrastructure. The web is a service that uses that infrastructure. Web content is usually built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript.

    <div class="meta">Feb 13, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is A computer is an electronic system that takes input, processes data, and produces output.
It follows instructions from software and represents data in binary (0 and 1).
Why Computers matter because they help people process information quickly and reliably.
They power:
communication and media education and research business and finance healthcare, transportation, and public services How does it work At a high level:
Input devices provide data (keyboard, mouse, sensors, network). The CPU executes instructions. RAM holds active data for fast access. Storage keeps data long term (SSD/HDD). Output devices show results (screen, speakers, files, network). Inside hardware, transistors switch on and off to perform logic and arithmetic operations.
