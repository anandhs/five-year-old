    <div class="meta">Feb 13, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">Computers feel like magic… but they’re actually super fast rule-followers.
A computer doesn’t “think” like a human.
It follows instructions very, very fast — using electricity and tiny switches.
1) Computers speak ONE simple language: 1s and 0s Inside a computer, everything becomes:
1 = ON 0 = OFF That’s it.
Games, YouTube, homework, Roblox, Minecraft — it all becomes huge patterns of 1s and 0s.
A computer is basically: Input → Processing → Memory/Storage → Output.

    <div class="meta">Feb 13, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">If you hear the word calculus, it probably sounds big. Complicated. Slightly terrifying.
Relax.
At its heart, calculus is just the math of change.
And if you’re five years old, you already understand change better than you think.
The World Is Always Changing Think about your day:
A balloon gets bigger when you blow into it 🎈 You ride your bike faster and faster 🚲 Rain fills up a bucket drop by drop 🌧️ You grow taller every year Nothing stays still.
