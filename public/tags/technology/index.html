    <p class="excerpt">What it is Bitcoin is a digital money system that works without a central bank.
Instead of one company controlling it, a global network of computers follows shared rules to record and verify transactions.
Why People use Bitcoin for a few main reasons:
to send value directly over the internet to use a system with a fixed supply (21 million coins) to use money that is not controlled by one country or company Whether it is a good choice depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and local laws.

    <div class="meta">Feb 13, 2026</div>
    <p class="excerpt">What it is A computer is an electronic system that takes input, processes data, and produces output.
It follows instructions from software and represents data in binary (0 and 1).
Why Computers matter because they help people process information quickly and reliably.
They power:
communication and media education and research business and finance healthcare, transportation, and public services How does it work At a high level:
Input devices provide data (keyboard, mouse, sensors, network). The CPU executes instructions. RAM holds active data for fast access. Storage keeps data long term (SSD/HDD). Output devices show results (screen, speakers, files, network). Inside hardware, transistors switch on and off to perform logic and arithmetic operations.
