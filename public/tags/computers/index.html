    <p class="excerpt">What it is A computer is an electronic system that takes input, processes data, and produces output.
It follows instructions from software and represents data in binary (0 and 1).
Why Computers matter because they help people process information quickly and reliably.
They power:
communication and media education and research business and finance healthcare, transportation, and public services How does it work At a high level:
Input devices provide data (keyboard, mouse, sensors, network). The CPU executes instructions. RAM holds active data for fast access. Storage keeps data long term (SSD/HDD). Output devices show results (screen, speakers, files, network). Inside hardware, transistors switch on and off to perform logic and arithmetic operations.
