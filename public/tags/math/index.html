    <p class="excerpt">What it is Calculus is the part of math used to study change and accumulation.
It has two core tools:
derivatives for rates of change integrals for totals built from many small parts Why Calculus helps when things are always changing, such as speed, growth, heat, flow, and cost.
It is widely used in:
science and engineering economics and finance medicine and biology computing and machine learning How does it work A derivative answers: &ldquo;How fast is this changing right now?&rdquo;
